Should I test this? the answer is a BIG YES. Tests are your friends, and saviors sometimes (often).

At Forward Financing we feel a big proud when our projects reach high test coverage, because thats our  
ensurance for making improvements and upgrades later with the warranty that existing functionality will  
keep working.

Mistakes can be happen, always, and that is where tests can be real saviors, as an alert that  
something was altered by mistake, or that some functionality is not providing the expected result.

Tests verifies that the application meets the requeriments, it guarantees the code makes what we expect  
it to do.
