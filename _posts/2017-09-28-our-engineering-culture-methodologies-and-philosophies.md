Every engineering group is different. Every engineering manager values different
aspects of their team. This list was put together by the engineering team at
_Forward Financing_.  

## Engineer's Flow  
There is an engineering management theory called "Flow" -- it's any state for an
engineer that is void of interruption and disruption. This
is when engineers do their best work, can tackle the hardest problems, and why
you'll often find our room either full of energy and boisterous or very very
quiet to the point you can hear a pin drop. We do many things to help get
engineers into Flow. Some rules we follow:  
1) Do not disturb if headset is on
2) Turn off Slack notifications when working on larger/harder problems
3) Flexible work-from-home policy to reduce visual noise and disruption from
outside parties

Here are some articles that speak specifically about Flow or topics close in
nature to Flow.

## Scrum  
Scrum is an Agile methodology that help teams get things done in as productive
a manner as possible. It allows the business to track project progress
transparently and get an idea of throughput based on estimation. Scrum allows
the product team (Product Managers and Engineer) to be able to set expectations
that stakeholders understand and abide by.
  
While none of us believes in burn down
charts, for those people who are far removed from the process, it can act as
a flag that a is sprint going well or falling behind.
  
The most important
piece of Scrum is the Retrospective. This is an open forum to discuss what went
well during the sprint, what failed, and what we can do as a team to address
the issues that led to the failures. Thus far, we have evolved our process with
our current team to address the issues that have arisen so far, and it has all
been for the better. Most importantly, we archive our Retrospective notes in
Confluence so we can track progress in fixing things that are broken with our
process.

Here are some articles that speak specifically about Scrum and its importance
in organizations.

## Blameless Culture  
Having a blameless culture is paramount for building a sustainable, long-lived
engineering culture. No matter the project, bugs are going to exist. Whether
it is due to miscommunication, misinterpretation, speed, lack of tests, etc.,
bugs will always be introduced into new and old systems alike.
It is of utmost importance to have a culture of _learning from
mistakes_ as opposed to vilifying the one individual who made the mistake.

Here is a link that better describe the nuance of a blameless culture and
it's benefits to a team and it's culture.

## Technical Debt  
Every company has technical debt, and it can take many forms. Some are legacy
projects that engineering teams inherit with its primary architects long gone.
Sometimes shortcuts are taken in order to meet deadlines. In either scenario,
technical debt has a negative
effect on health of systems, engineering productivity, and more. This topic,
which has been discussed in length in every possible forum, is of the utmost
importance due to its impact.

Here are some links about what technical debt is, and its place in
organizations.

## Code Review  
Code review is very important in every organization. It acts as a way to
educate other engineers about a project, a form of quality control
to prevent bugs from being introduced into systems and
mentorship as the feedback given helps engineers form better practices and
habits. While code reviews can be expensive, it is _the most important_ vehicle
we have to help identify and prevent new technical debt from being introduced
into the system.

## Continuous Delivery  
There are a lot of pros and cons around having a Continuous Delivery setup. We
have most of our applications (all but our application that handles money) on
continuous delivery. This methodology removes the ceremony around deployment.
Removing the deployment ceremony reduces engineer frustration, increases
engineer productivity, and so much more. From a business standpoint, features
get released faster and quicker.

Here are some articles about what continuous delivery is and its benefits to an
organization.

## Pair Programming  
It's difficult to concisely speak about the importance of pair programming.
Beyond the immediate impact it provides engineers, it also has long lasting
effects that can't be replaced with other frameworks. It helps form bonds of
mentorship and coaching toward improving the engineer who requested the pair. It
further strengthens trust and bonds between individuals as they build a rapport
and help each other through challenges.

While there are plenty of pro and con articles around the internet about
pairing, here are some about the positive benefits of it and why we use it
at Forward Financing:

## Testing  
Testing is another important vehicle that helps reduce technical debt from
being introduced into new systems and ensures that requirements are met. Tests
are a way an engineer can programatically understand if its functionality is
in fact doing what is intended.

Here are some articles about why testing is important and why companies decide
to invest in testing.

## Continuous Learning  
Continuous learning is nothing new to businesses, but has made a recent
resurgence in business culture. This framework allows companies to invest in
employees by giving them new skills, reinforcing old skills with new twists, and
more. This has so many positive effects on an organization that it is difficult
to enumerate them all. I tend to focus on two:
1) Employee retention
2) Employee growth

Here are some links that describe what continuous learning is and why it is important.

## Management  
Managing a team of engineers is often likened to herding cats. It is a tall task
that most people fumble through. Being the liaison between senior management and
engineers also has its own set of challenges. The two most important pieces
that any manager can do for engineers:
1) Guard rigorously against context switching
2) Facilitate growing trust throughout the team

Beyond those two, there is so much that happens to keep engineers happy,
motivated, and engaged. Here are some articles written by people who I respect in
the industry who have gone on to build some amazing engineering cultures:

## Product Development  
The process around how products are developed is important, but not the end-all
be-all. It is important to have structures and processes in place to foster
accountability. These structures help prevent friction
between other groups as they work together through a common goal. With that
said, the product will always beat the process. Until something hits the hands
of a customer, nothing matters until the product is in the hands of the
customer.

## Transparency  
The positive effects of transparency are no secret. Being transparent
allows for more straightforward communication. It allows for levels of trust to
be built that might not be achievable otherwise. It reduces worry, stress, and
even friction between individuals because there are no secrets. It helps build
relationships between individuals that further strengthen loyalty, empowerment,
and trust.

transparency:
